      Wondering what KKSystem is? It's a web application designed to help you
      study, so you can say goodbye to paper flash cards. KKSystem makes flash
      cards easier to write, organise, and study. The application provides a
      simple interface to create and edit cards, organise existing cards, and
      study the cards you've created using the %{leitner_system}. In addition,
      all of your data is stored in the cloud, so you can continue to write,
      organise, and study from any PC or mobile device.

      Each page within the application has documentation explaining how to use
      that page, but this information alone is not enough. Here you can read a
      general description of how to use the software.

    para-sets-boxes-cards: >
      KKSystem has three major types of entities: sets, boxes, and cards. You
      will create your own, so it's important to know what they do:
    para-cards: >
      Cards - Contain the information to be studied. Each card has a front and
      a back, containing text information.
    para-boxes: >
      Boxes - Define how well you know particular cards. The boxes specify the
      frequency at which the cards within should be reviewed. Examples: Every
      Day, Every Week
    para-sets: >
      Sets - Allow you to separate cards and boxes by their topic. Each set is
      entirely independent of eachother. Examples: 19th century British History,
      Arabic, Organic Chemistry

    the-leitner-system: The Leitner System
    para-leitner-1: >
      KKSystem implements the Leitner system. Originally designed by Sebastian
      Leitner, the system remains very popular today. The system makes each card
      more difficult as you memorise the content.
    para-leitner-2: >
      Boxes play an important role in the Leitner system. Each box signifies a
      different difficulty, and is given a review frequency. Once you've
      reviewed a box, you do not review that box again until the review
      frequency has passed. Each card correctly memorized is moved to the next
      box, which is reviewed less frequently. Once the card has left the final
      box, it has escaped the system, and you should know the content. If a card
      is not memorized, it is moved to the first box.

    modifications: Modifications
    para-modifications: >
      KKSystem modifies the Leitner system. In addition to the normal Leitner
      study model, you also have the option to review a specific box, or review
      cards which have escaped the system. This allows you to do more training
      or review cards you may not have reviewed for a while. In addition, you
      may specify a reintroduction rate and frequency. When in use, each time
      the reintroduction frequency passes, cards outside of the system are
      displayed during normal study. The amount of cards is determined by the
      rate. If any of these cards is no longer memorised, it enters the system
      again at the first box.

    development: Development
    para-development-1: >
      If you are a developer who would like to hack on KKSystem, go to the
      %{project_page}. Clone the repository, make your changes, fork the remote
      on GitHub, push your changes there, and submit a pull request. For
      small changes, you may also e-mail an active project member your patch if
      you wish.

      KKSystem is written in %{ruby} using %{rails}. Setup instructions for
      developers and server administrators exists in the source tree.
